## functionality:
* -> two step cryptography 
* -> step one : as mentioned in the requirement [generating key and decoded text with key]
* ->step two: base64 builtin encoder
# flow: 
*encodeflow: input-text -> key+Encoded string -> base64 encode
* decodeflow: encoded-text ->base64 decoder -> key+encoded string ->encode(using key)

-> extra feature : copy text feature, refresh feature, fully responsive design

## used language and framework:
